# Web RSS Reader / Bookmarking Page

* Simple RSS reader or a bookmarking page reliable on a cookie.
  - Add/remove pages, save your list and come back later to look at them.
* It was meant for only RSS feed usage, but can use it for most news sites.
  - Due to some websites having X-FRAME-OPTIONS set to block iframes.
  
Just a simple project I thought I would create.
